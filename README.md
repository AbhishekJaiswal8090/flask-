# UNDERSTANDING CONCEPTS OF DIFF REQ METHOD
When creating a server, different HTTP request methods serve distinct purposes, making interactions between clients and servers efficient. Here are the benefits of key request methods:
- GET: Used to retrieve data from the server without modifying it. It's fast and cacheable, making it ideal for fetching resources.
- POST: Sends data to the server, often used for creating new resources. It ensures secure data transmission and supports complex payloads.
- PUT: Updates or replaces an existing resource. It maintains consistency by ensuring the entire resource is modified.
- PATCH: Similar to PUT but updates only specific parts of a resource, reducing data transfer overhead.
- DELETE: Removes a resource from the server, helping maintain clean and efficient data management
